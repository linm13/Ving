A project of software development with Java

This is my first time to develop such a systematic and complex software and I cherish it very much.
This software is a package program of the software GridLabd.
Ving offers many functions for users, which can greatly reduce the threshould for users to do some simulations of power system.
The operation of the software is very friendly and simple, you can operate it just like operating the windows OS.

The interface for building circuit is as follow:

This is the interface for exhibiting the result:
